 sasm and C project

i) execution time and short analysis of the performance

ii) program output and correctness check

Note: program output of actual C file, without correctness check.

Note: our group implemented the formula into C as well and calculated the acceleration per car in C, in parallel to the assemblies computation. For your reference we included the C file we used for this correctness check as correctness_check.txt. This C file was only intended for checking if the output of the assembly code is correct, as such it isn't used as the final C file. To double double check we also did the calculations by hand, we based the formula from the specifications provided to the group.
